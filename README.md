1. how does property lookup work in javascript?
2. somewhat comfortable with constructor functions.
3. why `â€‹.prototype`?

# Prototypes

* when you google javascript methods, there is a `.prototype` in between the thing and the method.


## Object creation in JS

Object Litterals:

```js
var turtle = {
  legs: "flippers",
  swim() {
    return `kick your ${this.legs}`;
  }
};
```

Classes:

```js
class Turtle {
  constructor() {
    this.legs = "flippers";
  }
  swim() {
    return `kick your ${this.legs}`;
  }
}

const turtle = new Turtle();
```

Constructor functions:

```js
function Turtle() {
  this.legs = "flippers";
}
Turtle.prototype.swim = function() {
  return `kick your ${this.legs}`;
}

const turtle = new Turtle();
```

Every object in JavaScript has a [[Prototype]] that is another object.

The easiest way to set an object's [[Prototype]] is to set that object's `.__proto__` property.

It's just objects linked to other objects.

Every function in JavaScript has a property called `.prototype`. That is an empty object. This is not the function's [[Prototype]].
